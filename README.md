# Road_Accident_Analysis_PowerBi

📊 Overview

The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to visualize and analyze accident data to identify key trends, patterns, and insights related to road safety. The dashboard enables users to monitor accident severity, understand contributing factors, and support data-driven decision-making for improving road conditions and safety measures.

🎯 Objectives

1. Analyze total accidents and casualties by year.
2. Compare current year (CY) vs previous year (PY) performance.
3. Identify high-risk days, locations, and vehicle types.
4. Study the impact of weather, lighting, and road surface conditions.
